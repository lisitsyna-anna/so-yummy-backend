- Swagger UI Express for documenting and visualizing the API using Swagger documentation.
- Other dependencies such as axios, bcryptjs, cloudinary, cors, dotenv, joi, jsonwebtoken, morgan,
  multer, multer-storage-cloudinary, nanoid, nodemailer, and query-string are used for various
  functionalities within the backend.
